Error Correction with the Shor Code
Introduction
This project extends your work in Week 21 to implement, simulate, and analyze the first ever error correction code proposed that can handle any single qubit errors (bit-flips, phase-flips, or others) using the Shor code (Sho95).



Description
The Shor code is a natural extension of the Bit- and Phase- flip codes that avoid syndrome measurements where:

A bit-flip error means |0\rangle∣0⟩ unintentionally turning into |1\rangle∣1⟩ or vice versa.
A phase-flip error means |+\rangle∣+⟩ unintentionally turning into |-\rangle∣−⟩ or vice versa.
This code can be viewed as two levels of quantum error correction where:

The logical qubits are first encoded into a 3-qubit phase-flip code.
Each of the resulting physical qubits are encoded into a 3-qubit bit-flip code.


Key Questions
In this project, you will answer the following questions:

How does using the Shor code compare to using no error correction? Are there any trends you notice?

When using the Shor code, how does the average fidelity change with increasing probability of errors? Why is this?

Are there any unexpected patterns in the average fidelity? Why do you think they might be happening if so?

Part 2: Implementing the Shor Code
In this section, we will build on the work from the last section to implement Shor's code in full.

Initialize a circuit with the correct number of qubits. It is up to you to determine the correct number based on the description of the code below and any other resources at your disposal.



This code can be viewed as two levels of quantum error correction where:

Exercise #8
By only adjusting the qiskit code in the ERRORS section, determine a way to break this error correcting code (there are many solutions). For reference, there are actually 2 valid ways to break this code:

The qiskit code runs, but the initial and final states do not match.
The qiskit code itself doesn't run and gives the following output: QiskitError: 'Density matrix is not a pure state'.
NOTE: If you're curious, the second error is a sign of a change in the quantum state so serious that the qiskit function for creating the statevector effectively fails. In quantum physics, this particular change is called going from a "pure state" to a "mixed state".
